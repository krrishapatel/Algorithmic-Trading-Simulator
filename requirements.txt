# AI Trading Simulator - Core Dependencies
# This file contains only the essential packages needed to run the simulator

# Core Python packages (usually included with Python 3.11+)
# No external packages required - the simulator works with built-in Python modules!

# Optional: For enhanced development experience
# black==23.11.0          # Code formatting (optional)
# pytest==7.4.3          # Testing framework (optional)
# pytest-asyncio==0.21.1 # Async testing support (optional)

# Note: The trading simulator is designed to work with zero external dependencies
# All required functionality uses Python's built-in libraries:
# - http.server (web server)
# - socketserver (socket handling)
# - threading (multi-threading)
# - datetime (time handling)
# - random (simulation)
# - math (calculations)
# - statistics (performance metrics)
# - json (data serialization)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - typing (type hints)
# - enum (enumerations)

# To run the simulator:
# python3 simple_demo.py          # Terminal demo
# python3 trading_dashboard.py    # Web dashboard

# To install optional development tools:
# pip install black pytest pytest-asyncio
